**OVERVIEW:**
For the E-Learning Platform, I used React to create an engaging user interface where users can browse courses, view content, and track their learning progress. The front-end also includes dynamic features like video players, quiz sections, and progress bars. I employed React Router for navigation and CSS for styling, ensuring the platform is both responsive and accessible on all devices. This project enhanced my skills in building complex, dynamic front-end features and ensuring a smooth user experience.

In all these projects, I gained valuable experience in front-end development, focusing on React, JavaScript, and CSS to create interactive, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.
